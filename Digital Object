**Digital Object** means any digital data string, digital record or digital unit of account which is recognised by the Protocol Rules of a Digital Object Network as capable of:

1.	being uniquely associated with (or “owned”) by a particular Digital Address at any one time (including by reference to the relevant timechain or block height, if applicable); and
2.	being uniquely associated with (or “controlled”) by a Digital Key associated with that particular Digital Address;

In this definition the following terms have the following meanings:

**Confirmed** means a change of state of the distributed digital ledger or digital data structure in accordance with the Protocol Rules of the Digital Object Network which has become probabilistically irreversible.

**Digital Address** means a particular digital data string (including a public-key address) which is recognised by the relevant Digital Object Network.

**Digital Key** means a digital data string (including a private key or group of private keys) which is associated with a particular Digital Address by a mathematically verifiable, fault-tolerant scheme at any one time (including by reference to the relevant timechain or block height, if applicable), such that the digital data string (or another data string associated with or derived from it) is required to create any Digital Signature or to effect any state change (including a Transfer) to the Digital Object Network. 

**Digital Object Network** means a distributed digital ledger or digital data structure in which consensus as to the state of the distributed digital ledger or digital data structure is arrived at in accordance with the Protocol Rules of that Digital Object Network.

**Digital Signature** means a digital data string which:

1. is associated with or derived from a particular Digital Key via a mathematically verifiable, fault-tolerant process; and
2. allows for such association with or derivation from a particular Digital Key to be verified by otehr participants in the Digital Object Network.

**Protocol Rules** means a mathematically verifiable, fault-tolerant and sybil-resistant process which is followed by participating nodes in the Digital Object Network.

A **Transfer** of a Digital Object to a given Digital Address will be deemed to have occurred if:

1.	a transfer function has been submitted to the Digital Object Network that:
   (A) provides for the re-association of Digital Object with the receiving Digital Address (such “re-association” to include any replacement, modification, destruction, cancellation, or elimination of a Digital Object which results in a corresponding derivative creation and acquisition of a new Digital Object or a or derivative of that Digital Object); and
   (B) is signed by a particular digital or electronic data string (including a private key or group of private keys) which is recognised by the relevant Digital Object Network as sufficient to authorize the execution of such transfer function; and

2.such transaction is Confirmed.
